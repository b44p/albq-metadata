Digitizing Albuquerque Metadata
Albuquerque has a simple open data site that contains data listings that cover almost all services. Each of these datasets also has very good, detailed and structured metadata. However these metadata are stored in PDFs and it would be nice to have them as CSVs so that data can be made more searchable. 

This is an attempt to use a program called pdfgrep to extract common elements from each of these PDF metadata documents and provide a csv of all of Albequerque's metadata.
